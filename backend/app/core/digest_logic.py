"""Pure rules of the weekly summary «Qué falta documentar» (E4b): grouping of the unanswered questions, masking of personal
data in the examples, the windows of time and the limits of every section.

No dependency on Odoo on purpose: the pure checks load this module on its own (see docs/VALIDATION.md). The model
`buddy.digest` runs the queries and calls these functions; nothing here touches a database. The summary is made WITHOUT AI:
it is counting and a small grouping heuristic (words in common), which costs nothing and sends nothing anywhere.
